However, Gaijin does not guarantee to Demo Access holders the safety of their game progress, In-Game Items, or the possibility of transferring their Demo Account data to their personal Gaijin Account.

6. IN-GAME ITEMS AND APPLICABLE FEES

6.1. Gaijin’s Games are usually distributed on a free basis (unless otherwise explicitly stated by Gaijin or its distribution partners). Regardless of the distribution basis (paid, free, or otherwise), Gaijin usually offers for “real world” money the right to use the optional in-game data indented to extend or improve your gameplay and in-game experience, such as in-game virtual currency (for which you can buy other In-Game Items), DLCs, characters and virtual objects (vehicles, weapons, mounts, military equipment, etc.), as well as skins for them, any consumables and other items/features modifying your gameplay and enhancing your in-game experience (collectively, “In-Game Items”). Such In-Game Items constitute an integral part of the relevant Game, and the License covers their use to the same extent as the Game, including any and all applicable limitations. In-Game Items being offered or sold for one Gaijin’s Game are not compatible with any other game unless otherwise expressly facilitated and permitted by Gaijin.

6.2. The In-Game Items made available through the Gaijin services are licensed, not sold. The method and usage of the specific In-Game Items may depend on certain game mechanics and/or gameplay purposes. 

6.3. Any fees (whether in the form of In-Game currency or “real world” money) paid by you in exchange for any In-Game Items are non-refundable and cannot be exchanged for another In-Game Item unless: 

— such refund or exchange is explicitly and unambiguously consented to by Gaijin (for example, you can trade virtual currency for another In-Game Item strictly to the extent expressly allowed in the applicable Game);
— otherwise is provided by the Terms of Service;
— otherwise provided by applicable law as a mandatory rule.

PLEASE TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT GAIJIN DOES NOT MAKE ANY REFUNDS IN CASE OF, WITHOUT LIMITATION, YOUR GAIJIN ACCOUNT DELETION OR ITS OTHER EXPIRATION, LICENSE REVOCATION, OR OTHER EULA TERMINATION ON ANY GROUNDS.

6.4. Please also see our Terms of Service for more details on charging and billing any applicable fees made within Gaijin services (including store and marketplace for which we may invoke the additional rules being a part of the Terms and Conditions), including our Games. Please pay special attention to Sections 5 and 6 thereof.

7. GAME RULES AND SANCTIONS FOR BREACH

7.1. Gaijin has the right to establish the Game Rules for all or any particular Game. Such rules regulate (or sometimes limit) your behavior in our Games when communicating or otherwise interacting with other Players. Please read out carefully the Game Rules available at [https://legal.gaijin.net/gamerules] before playing our Games. 

7.2. When you breach the Game Rules, or your behavior is otherwise not consistent with them, we have the right, at our sole reasonable discretion, to invoke the following sanctions against you, depending on the seriousness of your breach or inappropriate behavior and the stipulations of the Game Rules with regard to particular violations:

— suspend your access to the “game chat” functionality in the Game;

— impose other sanctions provided by the Game Rules.

7.3. Failure to comply with the Game Rules constitutes a material breach of the Terms and Conditions. For your information purposes, “Material breach” means a substantial and serious violation of a legally binding agreement (which is the Terms and Conditions in this situation) that gives your contractual counterparty (which is Gaijin under the Terms and Conditions) lawful ground for immediate unilateral termination of such agreement and seeking any available remedies for such violation (which can be monetary ones, such as damages or compensation that you may have to reimburse).

7.4. Please note if we choose to delete your Gaijin Account, you will never be able to access it anymore. In such case, we are also entitled to prohibit you from accessing our Games in the future.

7.5. Gaijin independently decides on the violation and the applicable sanctions, including, at Gaijin’s sole discretion, by automatic means (for example, utilizing Easy Anti-Cheat mentioned in Section 4 above). However, you have the right to appeal Gaijin’s decision by contacting our Customer Support Service (for more details, please see Section 15 hereof).

7.6. If you encounter another User violating our Game Rules, including when such violations interfere with your right to play the Game, you can report them via in-Game tools designed for reporting or, as such tools are not available, via our Customer Support Service.

8. AGE RESTRICTIONS

8.1. Besides the minimum age necessary to accept the Terms and Conditions (including this EULA) as stipulated by the Terms and Conditions (16 years old or other age of necessary legal capacity in your country), please take into consideration that each Game also has its age rating or limitations (e.g., PEGI, ESRB depending on your region). 

8.2. Depending on your applicable law, if you (or your child who intends to play the Game) are under the minimum required age, you shall do the following:

— Refrain from using our Games;
— Consult your parents or legal guardian whether you can play the Game;
— Do other actions as required by the laws of your country.

IF YOU ARE UNDER 16 YEARS OLD (OR ANOTHER AGE THAT IS NECESSARY TO FULLY ACCEPT LEGALLY BINDING DOCUMENTS IN YOUR COUNTRY), PLEASE ASK YOUR PARENT OR GUARDIAN TO REVIEW THIS DOCUMENT AND APPROVE YOUR PLAY. YOU CANNOT PLAY OUR GAMES WITHOUT SUCH A CONSENT.

9. HEALTH PRECAUTIONS

9.1. You understand and agree that Game audiovisual content may aggravate epileptic and other neurological disorders.

9.2. You also acknowledge that continuous playing can lead to excessive fatigue that can provoke certain diseases, including impaired vision, various forms of spinal deformities, neuroses, and other health disorders. You are independently responsible for keeping track of the time spent while playing our Games, organizing breaks/rest, taking proper position while playing, and undertaking other precautions to keep your health safe. 

10. SYSTEM AND TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

10.1. Please note that the requirements mentioned below may periodically change, including in respect of the same Game. It is mostly connected with the changes to the Game being made by Gaijin from time to time, according to Section 11 of this EULA. Nevertheless, Gaijin also reserves the right to change such requirements in respect of any Games at its sole discretion.

10.1.1. Minimum requirements. Each Game is designed to be run on one or several specific platforms (operating systems or devices). In some cases, a Game may have its minimum technical requirements for your device (e.g., in terms of CPU, GPU, RAM, free storage, etc.), which are indicated by Gaijin on the Game’s official website, Game’s official page on a third party gaming platform or by other means at Gaijin’s discretion. Please ensure your platform meets such a minimum. Otherwise, Gaijin does not guarantee the Game’s launch or functioning and is not responsible for other flaws in the Game’s work. You are solely responsible for having sufficient device resources to store and launch the Game, including free Ram, storage, CPU and GPU load, etc.

10.1.2. Recommended requirements. For informational purposes and your convenience, we usually publish our Games' recommended requirements concerning your device's technical parameters. Please pay attention that such recommended requirements are designed for information purposes only and do not guarantee flawless functioning of the Game nor imply any other guarantee or warranty. For the avoidance of doubt, if a platform (whether device or operating system) is stated as a “recommended requirement” for a Game, it means the Game is designed to operate solely on such a platform. The same applies to other “recommended requirements,” which are clear to be necessary from the context.

10.1.3. Internet connection requirement. Usually, Gaijin’s Games require a stable high-speed Internet connection to work correctly and provide a good gaming experience. Please consider that Gaijin is not responsible for any flaws in Game work arising from the quality (including speed, reachability of Gaijin servers and response time, or so-called “ping”) of your Internet connection.

11. PATCHES, UPDATES, AND MODIFICATIONS

11.1. To ensure the best level of services, user experience, and Gaijin services efficiency within the Games, we need to patch, update and modify our Games from time to time. That usually results in mandatory and/or automatic updates of our Games, and the older versions may not launch or operate until you update them. 

11.2. Gaijin has the right to change the software code of the Game at any time at its sole discretion. Such changes may affect, among others, the functionality of the Game and its other content. For instance, we can add or remove Game content or features, fix bugs and errors, make balance changes, etc.

11.3. Please pay special attention that some patches, updates, and modifications may require (and over time will require) higher technical requirements to your device, or increase the device resources consumption by the Game, otherwise they may lead (and over time will lead) to performance drop of the Game and/or lower graphics or other settings.

11.4. By accepting this EULA, you confirm and acknowledge that your refusal to update the Game may make its further use by you impossible, and this EULA shall be deemed suspended until you update the Game.

12. LICENSE TERMINATION

12.1. Termination by User. You can terminate this EULA immediately by permanently stopping the use of our Games and deleting them from your device.
