+ last voxel scene cascade should be 2.5d (height based) - 8h.
  + We also should probably use alpha as 8 bits (2x2x2) to prvoide better details (coarser color than detail) - 4h
  + voxelize RI albedo (not collision)
    + invisible roofs
    + skip small ri
    + trees (6hr)
    * ri decals (4hr)

* 4 components gi (sky occlusion)
* better 2.5d scene voxels locations (i.e. quadric or something)
* reduce spike on teleportation:
  1) just voxelize
  2) first pass (if 4 components gi, can be non-intersected; otherwise: just lower 4 texels)
  3) second pass (if 4 components gi; otherwise: just higher 6 texels)
  4) only after that teleport 3d scene
