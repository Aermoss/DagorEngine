Short mention when to update spir-v tooling:
- DXC / glsang (for HLSLcc path) generate shaders with new spir-v spec
- render backend needs new spir-v spec support for some reason
- Otherwise update is not required as neither can the new features be produced nor consumed

Short instruction how to update spir-v tooling to new spir-v version:
- update 3rdPartyLibs/vulkan/spirv-tools/external/spirv-headers to latest spir-v headers from https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Headers
- update 3rdPartyLibs/vulkan/spirv-tools to latest spir-v tools from https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Tools
- ensure python 2.7 and clang-format can be run from cmd line
- run update_defs.cmd
- if everything went well tools are up to date
- if some drastic new things have been added the following files may need to be updated:
 + build.json - extend extension listing with json spec for extension with extended ops
 + instruction.properties.override.json - to add property overrides for auto_extrace_properties.py, use only for special case overrides
 + auto_extract_properties.py - if new properties are needed and/or new ways of detecting them is needed
 + node.declaration.json - to add new node types and/or properties to map to nodes
 + module.sections.json - if new spir-v module sections have been added
 + spec.ops.whit.list.json - if new instructions are allowed to be used with OpSpecOp

Notes:
- does not handle OpenCL debug / dwarf interop extension correctly (also no need for it)
- OpenCL language extension not build (no need)

Current version is 1.3 with extensions of rev 4
