Code itself: **Public Domain**.

There is 3rd party code under the testing framework (`testing/external`); it is not required for
using SMOL-V. Most of that code ([glslang](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glslang),
[LZ4](https://github.com/Cyan4973/lz4), [Zstd](https://github.com/facebook/zstd)) is BSD-licensed,
and taken from github repositories of the respective projects. [miniz](https://github.com/richgel999/miniz)
is public domain.

There are SPIR-V binary shader dumps under `tests/spirv-dumps` for compression testing;
these are not required for using SMOL-V. Not sure how to appropriately
"license" them (but hey they are kinda useless by themselves out of context),
so I'll go with this: "Binary shader dumps under 'tests' folder are only to be
used for SMOL-V testing". Details on them:
